## Disclaimer

There is currently no documentation for this library, nor are there currently
any plans to create documentation. This library was mostly created as a learning
exercise and is now publicly available in the hopes that others might find it
useful. Additionally it has been made available to show off my own talents as
part of my personal portfolio.
